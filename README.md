## 1. Purpose of the TimeEvolvingMPO package
The purpose of the TimeEvolvingMPO package is to make TEMPO related algorithms publicly accessable and easy to use. It aims at theoretical and experimental physicists that have little or no knowledge on the technical details of TEMPO. It is also designed to be easily extendable with current and future TEMPO related algorithms. It achieves this by distinguishing between physical information and algorithm specific information. The objects that represent the physical information can then be processed by different TEMPO related algorithms, thus also allowing for a playground to compare the performance of the algorithms for specific physical problems. 


## 2. General development organisation
The package is set up as an open source project (Apache license 2.0) at <https://github.com/tempoCollaboration/TimeEvolvingMPO>, and as such hopes to attract contributors outside the tempo collaboration. In addition to this there is a non-public copy of this repository at <https://bitbucket.org/jkeeling/tempoincubato>, which has at least one additional `development` branch. This repository can only be accessed by people that are part of the tempo collaboration (see Appendix A) and serves as an incubator for new features that are not yet public. Once a new feature is ready for publication (possibly with an accompanying preprint on arXiv.org) the feature can be merged into the public master branch.
